# Review and independent release gates

## Metadata-aware review is required

`mainframe.zowe_steps.run_review` invokes `review/runner/review_file.py` with
`--workspace`. `review/runner/workspace_inputs.py` resolves a per-program source,
program identity, scoped mapping/DCLGEN/copybook evidence and provenance. Earlier
reviews without that metadata skipped important checks; a report with no failed
checks did not mean those dependencies were verified.

The review registry contains checks 01 through 36. Families cover fixed layout,
DB2 infrastructure, residual IDMS, headers, SQL error routing, host/include
integrity, retrieval/update/commit conversion, declarations, EOC/nested cursors,
restart, SQL/select/INTO/predicates, naming/PIC/copybook use, ordering/lifecycle,
LR status/path expansion, scope balance, doubly driven paragraphs, generated
structure, group representation and production evidence.

The reviewer must preserve failures, blocked checks and exceptions for critical
or major obligations. Do not change acceptance merely to make the six fixtures
green. Static reports record their actual inputs and skipped checks; unresolved
external definitions do not become local proof.

## Independent semantic checks

`audit_generated_batch` pairs candidates with originals and manual references,
checks operation/table/field/key coverage and transaction/not-found questions,
checks output layouts/population and group-representation contracts, and produces
workspace `Review/semantic_release_gate.txt`. Structural review and this gate
both participate in step_review and standalone step_upload.

Independent verification modules include copybook provenance, fixed record
layout, write/population contracts, representation mismatch, manual direct UPDATE
parity, archive-date predicate modeling and fixed-record binary comparison.
Their scopes differ: equality of manual UPDATE assignments is not source IDMS
zero-row proof; equal record length is not correct record population.

## Current limitations must remain explicit

Do not collapse operation-local SQLCODE handlers, infer external SQLERROR or
USERABEN termination, waive mapping width conflicts, or infer compiler acceptance
from static parsers. Character-to-packed group checks expose an unsafe boundary;
they do not implement a serialization codec. The current baseline has rejected
candidates and no native compiler/runtime evidence.
