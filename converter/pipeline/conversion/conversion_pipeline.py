class ConversionPipeline(ConversionPipelineSteps):
    """Runs the CONTENT phase of the IDMS->DB2 conversion.

    Depends on the host class for the component factory methods and message
    helpers (via mixins). Returns (converted_cobol, operations,
    dclgen_repository); validation messages are appended to the passed-in
    list.

    The FINISHING phase - layout, paragraph extraction, counters, restart
    control, indent and resequencing - lives in ConversionLayoutPipeline.
    That split keeps the two concerns testable in isolation: this class
    decides WHAT the program says, that class decides HOW it is laid out.

    WHAT each step does lives in ConversionPipelineSteps. This file owns
    ORDER, and only order.

    Pass-ordering contracts (content phase)
    ---------------------------------------
    0a. LOGICAL RECORD EXPANSION. THREE stages, in this order, all inside
        ``_expand_logical_records``:

        1. ``LrfPathExpander``  - the READ and DELETE side::

               OBTAIN FIRST <LR> WHERE <keyword> -> OBTAIN FIRST <rec> WITHIN <set>
               ERASE <LR> WHERE <keyword>        -> ERASE <rec>
               FIELD OF <rec> OF LR              -> FIELD OF <rec>

        2. ``LrfUpdateExpander`` - the WRITE side::

               MODIFY <LR> WHERE <keyword>       -> MODIFY <rec>
               STORE  <LR> WHERE <keyword>       -> STORE <rec>

        3. ``LrStatusTokenReplacer`` - the status literals both expanders
           may leave behind::

               LR-STATUS = 'X-EOA'               -> DB-END-OF-SET -> SQLCODE = 100

        Stage 3 MUST run last: it consumes tokens the first two emit.

        The group MUST run first in the pipeline, because the PROGRAM KIND
        resolver, MappingScopeFilter, CobolTransformer and
        ProgramFlowAnalyzer all read the source text. Every pass after this
        point sees classic IDMS and needs no logical-record knowledge.

    0b. ``ProgramKindResolver`` measures UPDATE vs RETRIEVAL from the
        EXPANDED source. After 0a, because the update-side LRF forms are
        rewritten in stage 2 above; before statement transformation, which
        removes the write verbs entirely.

    0c. ``MappingScopeFilter`` rescopes the mapping validation report to the
        program being converted. MappingValidator audits the WHOLE Sheet
        Mapping workbook, so a restart-table gap was reported as a blocking
        error against every retrieval program that never touches it. A gap
        stays an error for a table this program references, and becomes a
        workbook note for any other.

    0d. ``_publish_lr_retrieval_state`` DELIVERS what 0a and 0b produced -
        the program kind, and the records for which 0a emitted a keyed
        parent access - to the statement transformer.

        MUST sit after 0b and BEFORE the transform, and nowhere else. The
        statement transformer does not appear in ``transformers`` under
        its own key: it is a constructor argument of CobolTransformer, so
        it was never offered the kind, and ``transform()`` calls
        ``_reset_statement_transformer()`` on entry. Publishing after the
        transform would arrive too late. See ConversionPipelineSteps
        CORRECTION 3.

    1.  ``feedback_cleanup`` (CobolCleanupComposer) runs
        ``OutputWritePlacementCleanup``, which lifts a guarded output WRITE
        out of the child-row paragraph into the PARENT paragraph, after the
        child cursor CLOSE. Left in the child-row paragraph the WRITE fires
        once per fetched child row instead of once per parent row.

    Steps 2 through 8 are owned by ConversionLayoutPipeline and documented
    there.

    CORRECTION 1 - THE WRITE SIDE WAS DOCUMENTED BUT NEVER RUN
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    Contract 0b used to claim the update-side LRF forms "are rewritten
    there", meaning by LrfPathExpander in 0a. That expander carries exactly
    three patterns - OBTAIN, OBTAIN continued, ERASE. It has never held a
    MODIFY or a STORE pattern, so an Update-with-LRF program kept::

        STORE  VMBTL07-R01 WHERE ST-VMBEVEF.
        MODIFY VMBTL07-R01 WHERE MO-VMBEVEF.

    all the way to the output, while the run log reported::

        LRF expansion: expanded 1 statement(s), skipped 0.

    "skipped 0" was not reassurance. A statement is only counted as skipped
    once it has MATCHED an LR pattern and then been refused. MODIFY and
    STORE matched nothing, so they were never seen as logical-record
    statements and never counted at all.

    ``LrfUpdateExpander`` had already been written and unit-tested for
    exactly these two verbs. It had no call site anywhere in the
    composition root - only in its own test module. Stage 2 above is that
    missing call site. The docstring claim is now true.

    CORRECTION 2 - THREE SILENT EXITS
    ---------------------------------
    ``_expand_logical_records`` returned the unmodified source whenever a
    transformer key was absent from the factory dict, and said nothing::

        expander = transformers.get("lrf_path_expander")
        if expander is None:
            return source_text          # no message

    A pass that was never WIRED is not the same thing as a program with no
    logical records, and silence cannot tell those apart. That is the same
    failure mode already recorded against the bare ``except Exception:
    pass`` that hid the LRF populator for three conversion cycles. Every
    stage now reports a missing component, a missing method, and a raised
    exception, and drains the component's own messages in all three cases.

    CORRECTION 3 - STEP 0d DID NOT EXIST
    ------------------------------------
    "The kind is now measured from the source, ONCE, and handed to every
    consumer that needs it", below, was true of the MEASUREMENT and false
    of the HANDOFF. ``_hand_off_program_kind`` had exactly ONE call site -
    ``retrieval_commit_cleanup``, inside ``_apply_commit_cleanup``. The
    statement transformer, which decides whether an OBTAIN CALC is a
    redundant positioning read or the only population of a DCLGEN host
    group, was never offered it.

    Measured on VMDZ4310: twelve MOVEs out of DCLDZBEFFTV and no SELECT,
    because the update rule was applied to a retrieval program. The kind
    was correct for all six programs on every run; only delivery was
    missing. Step 0d is that delivery.

    PROGRAM KIND - MEASURED, NOT CONFIGURED
    ---------------------------------------
    The kind used to come from ``self._program_is_update(conversion_input)``.
    ConversionInput carries paths and parsed metadata; it has never carried
    the IDMS write verbs. Once the workspace was flattened to a single
    Program folder - "One Program folder. No Retrieval / Update split" -
    the input's only kind signal disappeared and EVERY program resolved to
    retrieval. Update programs then silently lost restart control, their
    COMMIT and their business UPDATE, and the run log reported "Retrieval
    DB2 COBOL generation completed." for all of them.

    The kind is now measured from the source, ONCE, and handed to the
    consumers that need it. The input may still PROMOTE a program to
    update; it may not demote one whose source carries a write verb.

    RESTART CONTEXT
    ---------------
    The restart pass is run by the FINISHING phase, but its context can
    only be built HERE: finish() receives text and messages, never the
    conversion input, the DCLGEN columns or the program kind. The context
    is therefore built from the EXPANDED source - the checkpoint record
    is IDMS syntax and must be seen before it is converted away - and
    handed to ConversionLayoutPipeline through its constructor.

    The checkpoint record is written with the CLASSIC form - ``MODIFY
    FFRECAB``, ``STORE FFRECAB`` - which carries no ``WHERE <keyword>``
    clause. LR_MODIFY_WHERE_PATTERN requires that clause, so stage 2
    cannot match a checkpoint operation and restart handling is
    structurally out of its reach.

    TWO RESTART GENERATORS, ONE OWNER
    ---------------------------------
    ``SelectParagraphGenerator`` is the LEGACY restart path. It hardcoded
    the restart table, column and host names because it never read a
    DCLGEN, and it injected its own DZ01RSTV include and working storage.
    The metadata-driven pass (restart_injection, step 5b of the finishing
    phase) resolves every name from Sheet Mapping, DCLGEN and the program
    source, and MEASURES the checkpoint payload from the restart record
    layout - the value the legacy path guessed at 1215.

    Running both duplicated the DZ01RSTV include and left a PERFORM of a
    deleted handler. The legacy generator stands down whenever a restart
    context exists. See GATE_LEGACY_RESTART_GENERATOR.

    REGISTRY MIGRATION
    ------------------
    Passes marked MIGRATED are defined in converter/pipeline/registry.py
    and executed through run_stage(). The composer is constructed by the
    registry, not taken from the factory dict. Call POSITION is still
    owned by this file.

    SINGLE-OWNER PASS CONTRACT
    --------------------------
    Content transformations are each invoked once at their owning boundary.
    Cursor ordering runs only after cursor declarations and flow exist;
    restart-skip normalization runs once after statement transformation, before
    downstream cleanup can consume its markers. Re-running idempotent passes
    is not used as a substitute for a correct pipeline boundary.
